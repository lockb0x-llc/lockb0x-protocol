1. Current State Assessment
The repository only contains a stub CLI that prints informational messages; it does not create Codex Entries, interact with storage, sign data, anchor on Stellar, or verify anything.

The specification expects the reference implementation to demonstrate the full workflow—create, sign, anchor (on Stellar), certify, and verify Codex Entries—with supporting adapters, verifier library, and certificate tooling.

2. Minimal Specification Surface to Cover
Codex Entry data model: JSON structure with required fields for storage, identity, timestamp, anchor, and signatures, including revision support.

Identity rules: identifiers must be Stellar accounts, DIDs, or CAIP-10 accounts, following the canonical provenance hierarchy.

Storage adapters: at least IPFS, S3-compatible, and Google Cloud Storage adapters that emit RFC 6920 ni-URIs, jurisdiction metadata, and file size/type.

Anchoring: Stellar anchoring is mandatory; anchors must hash the Codex Entry and include CAIP-2 chain IDs, transaction hashes, and hash algorithms.

Signatures: JOSE JWS or COSE Sign1 with EdDSA, ES256K, and RS256 support; canonicalize JSON with RFC 8785 before signing/verification and honour multi-sig policies.

Verification: canonicalize, validate signatures, re-check integrity proofs, confirm location metadata, validate Stellar anchors, enforce encryption policy, and walk revision chains.

Certificates: generate at least JSON certificates binding integrity proofs, anchors, and signatures; support VC/X.509 bindings as optional extensions and provide revocation hooks.

Provenance metadata & security: preserve provenance assertions, support revision linkage, and respect security guidance on hashing, key ownership, replay protection, and jurisdiction claims.

Reference flow: exemplar sequence is file → storage adapter → signed Codex Entry → Stellar anchor → certificate → verification, which should drive CLI/API UX and testing.

3. Proposed Architectural Refactor
Solution layout

Lockb0x.Core: Codex Entry models, JSON schema validation, canonicalization, provenance utilities, revision-chain handling.

Lockb0x.Storage: IStorageAdapter interface plus IPFS, S3-compatible, GCS, and mock adapters implementing ni-URI generation, metadata extraction, and optional notarization.

Lockb0x.Signing: JOSE/COSE services, key management, Stellar account helpers, policy evaluation for multi-sig.

Lockb0x.Anchor.Stellar: Horizon client, transaction builder embedding Codex Entry hashes (MemoHash), CAIP-2 identifiers (stellar:pubnet / stellar:testnet), verification logic.

Lockb0x.Verifier: Implements the end-to-end verification pipeline, invoking canonicalization, adapter checks, anchor verification, and revision traversal.

Lockb0x.Certificates: JSON certificate emitter (minimum), plus VC/X.509 abstractions and revocation/status utilities.

Lockb0x.Cli: Rich CLI leveraging the above services for create/sign/anchor/verify/certify flows, mirroring the spec’s sample workflow.

Lockb0x.Api: Minimal REST service offering create/verify/certify endpoints backed by the same services.

Lockb0x.Tests: Unit tests, adapter fakes, Stellar testnet integration tests, and published test vectors.

Cross-cutting concerns

Configuration system for network selection, storage credentials, key stores, and policy thresholds.

Logging/auditing aligned with provenance assertions (e.g., wasGeneratedBy, wasAnchoredIn).

Security posture (client-side encryption hooks, revocation checks, replay protection).

4. Implementation Roadmap
Repository & tooling setup

Convert solution to multi-project structure above, add shared packages (e.g., System.Text.Json, stellar-dotnet-sdk, jose-jwt, JSON schema validator), and establish consistent dependency injection.

Core data model & validation

Implement strongly typed models reflecting required/optional Codex Entry fields, JCS canonicalization, ni URI helpers, and JSON schema validation against Appendix B schema.

Provide provenance helper objects for wasGeneratedBy/wasAnchoredIn assertions and revision linkage.

Storage adapters

Define IStorageAdapter contract (integrity proof, size, media type, location metadata, optional notarize/fetch) per Section 4.1.

Implement IPFS (CID + ni conversion), S3 (ETag → SHA-256 ni), and GCS (SHA-256 + crc32c) adapters with credential/config support, plus mock/local adapters for testing.

Add jurisdiction metadata enforcement and MIME/size capture.

Signing & key management

Build JOSE-based signing service supporting Ed25519, secp256k1 (via COSE or JWS), and RSA SHA-256, handling canonical payloads and multi-sig thresholds.

Implement key stores referencing Stellar accounts/DIDs and revocation checks in line with security guidance.

Stellar anchoring

Create Stellar service to derive entry hashes, build/submit transactions with memo payloads, map CAIP-2 chain IDs, and expose verification (Horizon queries, timestamp validation).

Support dry-run/testnet workflows for automated tests and CLI sandboxing.

Verifier library

Orchestrate verification steps (canonicalization → signatures → integrity → location → anchor → encryption policy → revision traversal) with detailed diagnostics.

Leverage adapters for metadata retrieval and anchor service for Stellar checks.

Certificate generation

Implement JSON certificate issuance using JWS, binding storage, anchor, and signer data; design extension points for VC and X.509 bindings and revocation endpoints.

Ensure certificates cite the correct Codex Entry ID and integrate with verifier.

CLI expansion

Add commands: init (configure adapters/keys), create (ingest file via adapter), sign, anchor, certify, verify, revision (history), aligning with Appendix A flow.

Provide JSON import/export, offline verification mode, and environment-aware config.

API service

Expose REST endpoints mirroring CLI operations for automation pipelines, with authentication hooks and streaming support for large files.

Testing & compliance assets

Create deterministic test vectors (sample entries, signatures, Stellar tx hashes) and automated tests covering adapters, signature validation, canonicalization, and verification matrix.

Add integration tests against Stellar testnet and mocked storage services.

Documentation & samples

Document CLI/API usage, adapter setup, key management, and Stellar anchoring instructions, referencing compliance and security considerations.

Publish example workflows matching Appendix A for users to replicate.

5. Risk & Dependency Notes
Stellar SDK integration: confirm availability of .NET Horizon client and handle rate limiting; support memo hash length limits to fit Codex Entry hash.

Cryptography libraries: ensure JOSE/COSE packages support required algorithms without violating security policies.

Adapter credentials: abstract credential management to keep secrets out of Codex Entries; consider environment variable or secret store integration.

Schema evolution: design serialization and canonicalization to be forward-compatible (extensions, optional fields) per provenance and security guidance.

Executing this plan will transform the stub CLI into the full reference implementation mandated by the specification while emphasizing Stellar anchoring and providing the tooling, adapters, and verification workflows necessary for interoperability.
