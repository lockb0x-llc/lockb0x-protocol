# GG24 Grant

This directory collects planning notes, deliverables, and reporting details for the GG24 grant track. The main technical deliverable is the Lockb0x.Anchor.Eth module, which provides Ethereum anchoring and verification for the Lockb0x Protocol.

### Key Deliverables

- **Lockb0x.Anchor.Eth**: Implements the Ethereum anchor and verifier workflow (see `/Lockb0x.Anchor.Eth/`).
- **Smart Contract**: Solidity contract for anchoring hashes and metadata (`Lockb0x_Anchor_Eth`).
- **SDK & CLI**: Node.js SDK and CLI for anchor/verify operations.
- **Test Coverage**: Hardhat and Foundry tests for contract and SDK.
- **Documentation**: Updated spec, usage guides, and grant reporting.

### Workflow Summary

1. Anchor a hash and metadata on Ethereum using the contract and SDK/CLI.
2. Retrieve and verify anchor details against the original artifact.
3. Use CLI or web UI for demonstration and reporting.

Suggested documents:

- Grant narrative drafts
- KPI tracking and status updates
- Partnership or stakeholder coordination notes
