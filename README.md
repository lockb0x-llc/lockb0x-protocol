# Lockb0x Protocol

[![Sponsor](https://img.shields.io/badge/Sponsor-Lockb0x%20Protocol-pink.svg)](https://github.com/sponsors/lockb0x-llc)

The **Lockb0x Protocol** is an open standard for proving the **existence, integrity, and custodianship** of digital data.
It‚Äôs designed for developers who need **verifiable audit trails** without locking into a single vendor, storage backend, or blockchain.

## üíö Support Lockb0x Protocol

Lockb0x is an open, standards-first protocol for verifiable data sovereignty.
If this project helps you, please consider sponsoring to sustain maintenance and new features.

At its core, Lockb0x provides a portable, signed JSON structure called a **Codex Entry**.
Each entry links together:

- **Storage Proofs** ‚Äî showing _where_ data is stored (IPFS, S3, Azure Blob, FTP/SFTP, or local storage).
- **Integrity Proofs** ‚Äî hashes and checksums that prove the data hasn‚Äôt been tampered with.
- **Signatures** ‚Äî cryptographic signatures/attestations from the data owner or organization.
- **Anchors** ‚Äî blockchain transactions (e.g. Stellar, Ethereum, Avalanche) that provide immutable timestamps.

By combining these, developers can create **tamper-evident, verifiable chains of custody** for files, records, or datasets.

**Implementation Status (October 2025):**

The Lockb0x Protocol reference implementation currently includes:

- **Core**: Data model, canonicalization, and validation (fully implemented and tested)
- **Signing**: Cryptographic signing and verification (Ed25519, ES256K, RS256; fully implemented and tested)
- **Storage**: IPFS adapter implemented and tested; S3, Filecoin, Azure Blob planned
- **Anchor.Stellar**: Mock/in-memory anchoring implemented and tested; real Stellar network integration pending
- **Verifier**: Fully implemented and tested. The pipeline orchestration, stepwise verification logic, and all verification steps (schema, canonicalization, integrity, signatures, anchor, revision chain, certificate) are covered by deterministic unit tests. IPFS + Stellar verification flow is implemented and passing.
- **Certificates**: Interfaces and models present; certificate emission and revocation logic planned
- **CLI & API**: CLI exists but is not yet integrated for end-to-end flows; API is planned
- **Tests**: All modules covered by unit tests; all tests pass except Secp256k1 (platform limitation)

**Gaps & Next Steps:**

- Integrate real Stellar SDK/Horizon for network anchoring and verification
- Expand documentation and add more end-to-end examples for the Verifier module and protocol pipeline
- Integrate CLI and API for end-to-end flows and workflow commands
- Expand storage and blockchain adapters (S3, Filecoin, Azure Blob, Ethereum, Avalanche, etc.)
- Add contributor guide, CLI usage docs, and end-to-end examples
- Refactor error handling and implement centralized logging

Plain English: Store any kind of data, encrypted or not, on any storage media/platform and use any blockchain. With the lockb0x-protocol and a Codex Entry, you can always prove it hasn't been tampered with, when it was created and by "whom", and who has control or "custody" of the data/asset. If the control ever changes, the protocol follows it. The lockb0x-protocol is not a storage specification.

It is a solution for data sovereignty that also provides the basis for Controllable Electronic Records, or a CER.

The lockb0x CER is in compliance with and serves as of machine-readable implementation of a CER as defined under United States Uniform Commercial Code Sections 12, 9, 8, and 1.

Which was revised in 2022 to address and regulate using blockchain accounts and cryptocurrency in commerce. In addition to defining custody by control as a proof of ownership. I.E., your keys, your tokens; or data/documents/assets as the case may be.

It has been adopted by all 50 states and territories of the U.S. and the lockb0x protocol is intended to be used as a reference implmentation of these modernized transaction processing capabilities for use in commerce.

The lockb0x-protocol, by design supports the standards and ethos of GDPR and is an enabler of personal data ownership and
control.

The lockb0x-protocol Verifier Reference Implementation is under development.

## Contributor Guidance & Example Flow

Please fork this repo and contribute by submitting a pull-request. Use the Issues tab to ask questions, discuss, or report issues.

**Example IPFS + Stellar Verification Flow:**

1. Store file in IPFS (using IpfsStorageAdapter) ‚Üí obtain CID and ni-URI integrity proof
2. Create Codex Entry with required fields (id, storage, integrity_proof, identity)
3. Canonicalize entry (RFC 8785 JCS)
4. Anchor entry on Stellar (mock/in-memory for now)
5. Sign entry with user's private key
6. Generate certificate (JSON, VC, or X.509)
7. Verify: recompute file hash, validate signatures, confirm anchor transaction on Stellar

See [Appendix A: Example Flows](spec/appendix-a-flows.md) for more details.

## Why Developers Should Adopt the lockb0x-protocol

- **Cross-Backend Portability**: works the same whether you use IPFS, S3, or a private server.
- **Standards-Aligned**: builds on RFC 6920 (integrity URIs), RFC 7515 (JOSE signatures), W3C DIDs, and Verifiable Credentials.
- **Easy Verification**: a simple verifier can check hashes, signatures, and anchors.
- **Interoperable**: doesn‚Äôt replace your storage or blockchain ‚Äî it ties them together.
- **Compliance Ready**: supports legal frameworks like GDPR (EU) and UCC Section 12 (US).

## Example Use Cases

- Proving a dataset hasn‚Äôt changed between research collaborators.
- Providing auditors with cryptographically verifiable compliance documents.
- Anchoring invoices, contracts, or deliverables for cross-organization projects.
- Creating a digital chain of custody for supply chain or legal evidence.

## Specification

The full technical specification lives in [`spec/v0.0.2-public-draft.md`](spec/v0.0.2-public-draft.md).
Each section of the spec is broken out into its own file in the [`spec/`](spec/) folder for clarity.
