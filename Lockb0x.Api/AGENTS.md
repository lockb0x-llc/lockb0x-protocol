# Lockb0x.Api â€” AGENTS.md

## Agentic Integration Guide

Lockb0x.Api exposes the protocol as a web API for agentic, automated, and interactive workflows. This guide provides actionable instructions for agent developers integrating with the API endpoints.

### Key Integration Patterns

- Automate Codex Entry creation, signing, anchoring, verification, and certificate management via REST endpoints
- Use OpenAPI documentation for endpoint details and payload schemas
- Integrate with agentic clients, CLI, and external systems
- Extend controllers and middleware for custom agent workflows

### Best Practices

- Validate payloads against protocol schema before submission
- Use deterministic test vectors for CI and agentic automation
- Handle error responses and diagnostics for robust agent workflows

### Next Steps

- Expand OpenAPI documentation and usage examples
- Integrate with CLI and agentic scripts for end-to-end automation
