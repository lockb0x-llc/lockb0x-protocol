# Lockb0x Protocol — Specification v1.0.0

**Status:** Public Release  
**Date:** TBD  
**Editor:** Steven Tomlinson  
**Category:** Standards Track

## Abstract (Non-Normative)

The Lockb0x Protocol defines a verifiable, storage-agnostic mechanism for proving the existence, integrity, and custodianship of digital data. It provides a uniform way to generate and verify **Codex Entries** — signed data objects that link together storage proofs, cryptographic signatures, and blockchain anchors.  

The protocol is designed to support data sovereignty, compliance with legal frameworks such as GDPR and UCC Section 12, and cross-organization trust, without replacing existing storage or identity systems. Instead, it acts as a verification and provenance layer that is portable across multiple backends.
