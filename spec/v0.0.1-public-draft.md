## Abstract (Non-Normative)

The Lockb0x Protocol defines a verifiable, storage-agnostic mechanism for proving the existence, integrity, and custodianship of digital data. It provides a uniform way to generate and verify **Codex Entries** — signed data objects that link together storage proofs, cryptographic signatures, and blockchain anchors. Signatures are created after anchoring to ensure they cover the entire Codex Entry including anchor references. Encryption is optional; plaintext assets are valid Codex Entries when stored without encryption. Integrity proofs MUST use ni-URIs; `ipfs://CID` URIs are supported for interoperability but ni-URIs are required.

The protocol is designed to support data sovereignty, compliance with legal frameworks such as GDPR and UCC Section 12, and cross-organization trust, without replacing existing storage or identity systems. Instead, it acts as a verification and provenance layer that is portable across multiple backends.
