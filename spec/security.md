Security is a foundational requirement of the Lockb0x Protocol.  
This section defines mandatory security measures and recommended practices for implementers.

---

## 11.1 Client-Side Encryption

- All sensitive data MUST be encrypted client-side before storage.  
- Encryption MUST use strong, peer-reviewed algorithms (AES-256-GCM, ChaCha20-Poly1305).  
- Keys MUST NOT be exposed to storage providers or third parties.  
- Multi-sig contexts MUST enforce policy rules before releasing decryption keys.

---

## 11.2 Hashing and Integrity

- Integrity proofs MUST use collision-resistant algorithms (SHA-256, SHA-3).  
- Hash truncation MUST NOT be used for integrity proofs.  
- Verifiers MUST recompute and compare the full hash against the declared proof.  

---

## 11.3 Key Ownership Validation

- Each signature MUST correspond to a valid, non-revoked key.  
- Multi-sig policies MUST validate that required thresholds are met.  
- Verifiers MUST check revocation status (e.g., CRLs, status endpoints).  
- Stale or expired keys MUST NOT be accepted for new Codex Entries.  

---

## 11.4 Replay and Forgery Protections

- Anchors MUST include unique identifiers (tx_hash) to prevent replay.  
- Codex Entries MUST use canonicalization ([RFC 8785]) to prevent signature forgery via structural variations.  
- Implementations SHOULD employ nonce or timestamp fields to further protect against replay.  

---

## 11.5 Jurisdictional and Compliance Risks

- Codex Entries asserting jurisdiction MUST be cryptographically anchored.  
- Implementations SHOULD consider regulatory requirements (GDPR, eIDAS, UCC Section 12).  
- Sensitive personal data MUST be minimized and, where possible, pseudonymized.  

---

## 11.6 Threat Models

Implementers MUST consider the following attack vectors:

- **Key Compromise**: Mitigated by multi-sig, hardware security modules (HSMs), and key rotation.  
- **False Jurisdiction Claims**: Mitigated by anchoring and certificate binding.  
- **Hash Collisions**: Mitigated by modern cryptographic algorithms.  
- **Malicious Storage Providers**: Mitigated by client-side encryption and integrity proofs.  
- **Replay Attacks**: Mitigated by unique anchors and canonicalization.
