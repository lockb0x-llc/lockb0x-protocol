# 1. Scope (Non-Normative)

The Lockb0x Protocol defines a verifiable, storage-agnostic mechanism for proving the existence, integrity, and custodianship of digital data. It is **not a storage protocol**; rather, it operates as a verification and provenance layer that can sit atop existing storage and blockchain systems.

The protocol addresses the following objectives, and is based on compliance with UCC Article 12 revisions (US) and EU Data Sovereignty policies:

- **Data Sovereignty**: enabling organizations and individuals to assert control over where and how their data is stored, independent of the underlying provider.  
- **Compliance & Auditability**: originating in the need to address UCC Article 12 (Controllable Electronic Records) in the United States and EU Data Sovereignty regulations, while also providing a verifiable chain of custody suitable for GDPR and related digital asset regulations.  
- **Cross-Organization Trust**: allowing multiple independent parties to share and verify data without reliance on centralized authorities.  

The Lockb0x Protocol does not replace existing standards for storage, encryption, or identity. Instead, it builds upon them by defining a **Codex Entry** abstraction that unifies storage proofs, cryptographic signatures, organization/process/artifact identity bindings, and blockchain anchors in a consistent, verifiable format.
